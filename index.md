<p>
  I'm currently an Engineer at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. <br> <br>
  
  As part of Lam's rotation program, I am spending 6 months at a time in three different business units. I started out in a Process Enginering Role in a Concept & Feasibility group working on developing Lam's dry EUV photoresist technology and now I am in a Product Engineering role in an Etch Product Development group. <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br> 
  
  I'll periodically also post updates on personal projects outside of my job here.
